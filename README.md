## What is GotNotes?

GotNotes is an online platform for college students to create communities around shared classes and share class notes.

## Why GotNotes?
As college students, we have all spent hours in various note sharing websites like Chegg, CourseHero, etc. to find that *specific* document we need to study for an upcoming exam.

How often did we find what we were looking for? <br/>
**Not that often.**

How often were we able to create a community to ask and answer questions with our peers? <br/>
**Almost never.**

Were we bombarded with ads that forced us to pay something to get something? <br/>
**Every. Single. Time.**

You'll suffer no longer my friend, GotNotes is here to save you!

## For whom?
This is for all college students who are fed up with currently existing course note sharing platforms that prey on students by asking for a payment for any useful feature that we could need.

## How?
The how is *simple*:
* Sign up
* Select a university
* Browse the course catalogue
* Subscribe to the courses you are taking
* Get the new notes that shared via your feed
* Share your notes with others
* Chat with your classmates in the automatically generated course group chat 

## Scope
These will be implemented:
- [x] File upload and download systems that supports jpeg, pdf, doc, docx, pages.
- [x] Easy to use, minimalist, modern, and mobile friendly layout with ReactJS.
- [x] Login/Sign-up Page
- [x] Page with college and course Selection lists
- [x] Page with subscribed courses and lists of documents shared to that course
- [ ] Live chat rooms with websocket
- [ ] Authenticated logins
- [ ] React Native
